Hello! I am Andrea, PhD candidate in Quantitative Economics at the [CENDEF group](https://cendef.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam. [Here is my CV.]({attach}/cv/Academic_CV.pdf)

### PhD


I work on economics of networks and environmental economics. Particularly **differential games** and **production networks**. I am currently working on a few papers. Check my [research page](/pages/research.html) for more details. 



### On the side
I love math and computers. I like playing around with [Prolog](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/prolog-playground) and [Clojure](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/dietary-monitor). I also do some recreational math. I love games of no chance, mainly chess and [domineering](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/domineering/). I also like [hot water bottles](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/01/the-revenge-of-the-hot-water-bottle.html) and economic history, especially history of central banking (checkout [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2599884) very good paper).
