Hello everyone. My name is Andrea. I am guy interested in math, biology, and economics. 

Looking into getting a PhD at the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home) sometime soon. 

I am mostly interested in [trophic analysis]({filename}/articles/trophicanalysis.md) at the moment, history of central banking, and game theory ([cooperative](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/tinbergen/tree/master/homework/adv_gametheory) or [evolutionary](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/tinbergen/tree/master/homework/evolutionary), would like to get into compositional).

- Follow me on
