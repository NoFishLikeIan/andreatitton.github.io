Hello! I am Andrea Titton a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam.

I am mostly interested on production networks in Economics. In particular, how do firms make decision about input goods, how do these decision induce a production network, and how does this network adjust after a crisis. I mainly focus on easing endogenous production network models by using graphons or on applying spectral methods (e.g. [trophic analysis]({filename}/articles/trophicanalysis.md)) on the empirical side.

I am also interested in cooperative (checkout my [package](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/CooperativeGames.jl)), evolutionary, and compositional game theory.
