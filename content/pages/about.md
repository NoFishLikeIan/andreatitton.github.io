<br/><br/>

Hello! I am Andrea Titton a PhD candidate at the [CENDEF](https://cendef.uva.nl/) (University of Amsterdam)

## Current research

My work is on production networks in Economics: How do firms make decision about input goods? How do these decision induce a production network? Can a crisis trigger a phase transition in production networks?

Currently my main focus is on theoretically simplifying endogenous production network models using graphons and analysing data using spectral graph theory (e.g. [trophic analysis]({filename}/articles/trophicanalysis.md)).

<br/><br/>

## Other stuff I am working on...

- cooperative ([package](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/CooperativeGames.jl)), evolutionary, and compositional game theory
- cross-border electricity markets ([draft work](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/prosumer-electricity-markets))
- influence of institutional investors in decision making in firms ([draft work](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/nlp-financial-env))
- bayesian motion perception ([code](https://github.com/phijoh/kalman-project))

<br/><br/>

## On the side
I am also a math and computer lover. I play around with Prolog and Clojure, and I like to do some amateur mathematics.
