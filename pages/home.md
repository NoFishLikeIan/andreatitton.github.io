Hello! I am Andrea, PhD candidate in Quantitative Economics at the [CENDEF group](https://cendef.uva.nl/) of the University of Amsterdam at the [Tinbergen Institute](https://tinbergen.nl/), under the supervision of [Florian Wagener](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/a/f.o.o.wagener/f.o.o.wagener.html) and [Cees Diks](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/d/i/c.g.h.diks/c.g.h.diks.html). 

### Job Market

**I am currently on the job market.** Find:
 - [latest version of my JMP here](../static/docs/tipping-point.pdf) and
 - [my CV here.](static/docs/titton-cv.pdf)

My reference letter writers are [Florian Wagener (Uni. of Amsterdam)](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/a/f.o.o.wagener/f.o.o.wagener.html), [Cees Diks (Uni. of Amsterdam)](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/d/i/c.g.h.diks/c.g.h.diks.html), and [Rick van der Ploeg (Uni. of Oxford)](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/people/rick-van-der-ploeg-0).

My research focuses on *climate tipping points* and their economic consequences. I am more broadly interested in *environmental economics* and *game theory*, particularly differential and network games. 

You can find my work in progress under [research](/research).

### On the side

I like math and computers. I often play around with [Prolog](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/prolog-playground) and [Clojure](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/dietary-monitor). I love games of no chance, mainly chess and [domineering](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/domineering/). I also like [hot water bottles](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/01/the-revenge-of-the-hot-water-bottle.html) and economic history, especially history of central banking.
