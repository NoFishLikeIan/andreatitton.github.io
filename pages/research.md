## Economics

- [**Endogenous Fragility in Opaque Supply Chains**](../static/docs/endfrag.pdf) - 2022
    Can supply chain unobservability generate endogenously fragile production network? I investigate this in a network production game.
- [**The Perils of Abatement Procrastination in the Presence of Tipping Points**](../static/docs/tipping-point-abatement.pdf) - 2023
    I model a stylised ice-albedo tipping point in the climate dynamics and study the consequences this has in determining optimal emissions in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. I show that the presence of a tipping point prescribes ambitious abatement policies, not only in scope but, crucially, in timing.
- **Blurred Price Signals in EU Emissions Trading System** - 2023 
    Is there a link between volatility in the secondary market of emission permits and firms’ innovation incentives? Should regulators step in and stabilise permit prices?


## Law \& Finance

- **An NLP analysis of institutional investor’s stance towards environmental sustainability** (with [Davide Grossi](https://davidegrossi.me/), [Alessio M. Pacces](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/p/a/a.m.pacces/a.m.pacces.html), [Xinyi Wang](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/a/x.wang/x.wang.html)) - 2021
    We use computational techniques to identify influence of institutional shareholders on corporate decision-making.

## Neuroscience

- **Bayesian Model of Motion Extrapolation** (with [Philippa Johnson](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/philippa-johnson)) - 2022
    How does the brain compensate for neural delays during motion perception?
